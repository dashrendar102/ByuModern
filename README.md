The official BYU Suite by BYU's Office of Information Technology is a collection of apps that are all accessible through the main BYU app. Some of the apps are very simple, such as an app to display your ID card, and other apps are a little more complicated, such as an app to find the content of any given vending machine on campus or where to find the nearest available BYU Cookies and Cream Milk. Some of the apps are links to BYU web pages or other BYU apps. Each app is specifically targeted towards BYU students. This project will attempt to complete as many apps as possible during a course of this semester. This will allow any BYU student, who uses Windows 8, to easily access BYU's services and information relevant to the student.
